# BayesianNetworks-AI
> a study of bayesian networks and logical inferences

## Overview
This project is part of my Artificial Intelligence studies and involves the creation of autonomous bots to detect and seal atmospheric leaks in a simulated environment aboard the space vessel Archaeopteryx. The primary focus is on leveraging Bayesian networks and logical inference to enable the bots to navigate and make decisions within a 50x50 grid of the ship.

## Features
* __Deterministic and Probabilistic Leak Detection__: Implements two types of bots, each using different strategies (Boolean detection and probabilistic sensors) to locate leaks.
* __Performance Analysis__: Includes a framework for evaluating the efficiency of each bot in various scenarios, including environments with multiple leaks.
* __Dynamic Scenario Adaptation__: Features advanced algorithms to handle scenarios with moving targets, like an alien intruder.
